Sage is a WordPress starter theme with a modern development workflow.

* CSS framework options:
  * [Bootstrap 4](http://getbootstrap.com/)

See a working example at [roots-example-project.com](https://roots-example-project.com/).

## Requirements

Make sure all dependencies have been installed before moving on:

* [PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/install.php) >= 5.6.4
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) >= 6.9.x
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

## Theme installation

Install Sage using Composer from your WordPress themes directory (replace `your-theme-name` below with the name of your theme):

```shell
# @ app/themes/ or wp-content/themes/
$ composer create-project roots/sage your-theme-name dev-master
```

During theme installation you will have the options to:

* Update theme headers (theme name, description, author, etc.)
* Select a CSS framework (Bootstrap, Foundation, none)
* Add Font Awesome

## Theme setup

Edit `src/setup.php` to enable or disable theme features, setup navigation menus, post thumbnail sizes, and sidebars.

## Theme development

Sage uses [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) as a build tool and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage front-end packages.

### Install dependencies

From the command line on your host machine (not on your Vagrant development box), navigate to the theme directory then run `yarn`:

```shell
# @ example.com/site/web/app/themes/your-theme-name
$ yarn
```

You now have all the necessary dependencies to run the build process.

### Build commands

* `yarn run start` — Compile assets when file changes are made, start Browsersync session
* `yarn run build` — Compile and optimize the files in your assets directory
* `yarn run build:production` — Compile assets for production

#### Additional commands

* `yarn run rmdist` — Remove your `dist/` folder
* `yarn run lint` — Run eslint against your assets and build scripts
* `composer test` — Check your PHP for code smells with `phpmd` and PSR-2 compliance with `phpcs`

### Using Browsersync

To use Browsersync you need to update `devUrl` at the bottom of `assets/config.json` to reflect your local development hostname.

If your local development URL is `https://project-name.dev`, update the file to read:
```json
...
  "devUrl": "https://project-name.dev",
...
```

If you are not using [Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/), update `publicPath` to reflect your folder structure:

```json
...
  "publicPath": "/wp-content/themes/sage/"
...
```

By default, Browsersync will use webpack's [HMR](https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement.html), which won't trigger a page reload in your browser.

If you would like to force Browsersync to reload the page whenever certain file types are edited, then add them to `watch` in `assets/config.json`.

```json
...
  "watch": [
    "assets/scripts/**/*.js",
    "templates/**/*.php",
    "src/**/*.php"
  ],
...
```
