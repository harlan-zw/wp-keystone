Sage is a WordPress starter theme with a modern development workflow.

**Sage 9 is in active development and is currently in beta. The `master` branch tracks Sage 9 development. If you want a stable version, use the [latest Sage 8 release](https://github.com/roots/sage/releases/latest).**

## Features

* Sass for stylesheets
* ES6 for JavaScript
* [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) for compiling assets, optimizing images, and concatenating and minifying files
* [Browsersync](http://www.browsersync.io/) for synchronized browser testing
* [Laravel's Blade](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/blade) as a templating engine
* CSS framework options:
  * [Bootstrap 4](http://getbootstrap.com/)
  * [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
  * None (blank slate)
* Font Awesome (optional)

See a working example at [roots-example-project.com](https://roots-example-project.com/).
